// THE TUTORIAL LOOKS AROUND FIRST, AND ANSWERS A REPLY.
//
// Her three notes after walking the downloaded app as a new user, 2026-10-06
// (w-9f6975906c):
//
//   "hitting 'to' doesn't matter because we're in single player mode so it's
//    only ever 'to' the agent."
//   "your first task doesn't let you actually reply but forces you to do 'e'"
//   "it's hard to understand the app as a whole because it just jumps to
//    creating a new task without spending a second on the interface"
//
// What was measured by driving a throwaway new-user copy of the app end to end
// before the change: the walk went hand-off, plus, To, send, with nothing
// said about the inbox in between; the new thread card opened with an empty
// box, because it mounted one beat before the walk handed it the words; a
// reply on her first thread moved the walk on but nothing ever answered it,
// so the thread sat in In progress for the rest of the walk; and a new user's
// last screen was "No agents to bring across yet" over a ~/.claude/agents
// path. After the change, all four are gone, and the same drive goes welcome
// to landing with a reply on the way.
//
// One describe per change. Everything here is behaviour, except where the
// wording IS the behaviour (what the reply card tells her to do).
